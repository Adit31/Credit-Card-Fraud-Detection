# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Data Science project using python for credit card fraud detection from our dataset.

To run the code in the .ipynb file, download the dataset uploaded. Due to the file-size restrictions, I've uploaded the dataset in three parts.
Although in the code, you'll find "df = pd.read_csv('dataset/creditcard.csv')" in cell number 2 (In [2]) because the dataset has been used as a whole for this project.

Either change the the read_csv part to mention the right path and file-name, or merge the three files into one on your system and rename the new file accordingly.
